RFID Web-App

This is full stack web application constructed using Node.js, and designed with React.js. MySQL is used for database management.

It's designed for schools, parents and students to store, manage and manipulate - biographical, geographical, medical and allergic information. It aims to identify people's allergies using an RFID Band. User data is stored using a unique RFID code. For example, dining halls in schools will use this web-app to detect a student's allergies and will thus show a list of food items available for them.
