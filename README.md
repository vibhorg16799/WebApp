RFID Web-App

This is full stack web application constructed using Node.js, and designed with React.js. MySQL is used for database management.

It's designed for schools, parents and students to store, manage and manipulate - biographical, geographical, medical and allergic information. It aims to identify people's allergies using an RFID Band. User data is stored using a unique RFID code. For example, dining halls in schools will use this web-app to detect a student's allergies. The input is the RFID code allotted to each student. The output is all the relevant information, an institution needs. They will thus show a list of food items available for the student.
